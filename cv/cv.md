3. First of all i want to say that i very like frontend development. I couldn't find my place in software development until met frontent (particularly js, ts and Angular 7). I spent 4 years of university and achive nothing, but at the last course i had to do graduate work and met angular 7. Instantly i fall in love. Probably i dont know enough... for sure i dont know enough ) , but i want to learn, and want to create any significant project in group of developers in future.
4. I can say that i know HTML5 and CSS3. Know flex, grid, bootstrap and some more, can create any landing pages. Learning js(es5, es6+), ts. Know angular 7 (my graduate work was on this)  i'm sure that i don't know it well enough, but i its so interesting to learn for me. Know nodejs(express, mongoclient) and mongodb. 2 last i know very small. I used it to get requests from front and save(delete) in database, nothing more.
